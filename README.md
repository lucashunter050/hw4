# hw4
csci104 hw4 avl tree

Part 1 is in q1.pdf - I made sure to promote the successor because that was what the question specified, 
                      while in the later AVL tree implementation, I promoted the predecessor.
                      
Part 2 is in equal-paths.cpp and equal-paths.h - The recursion was done entirely in the helper method.

Part 3 is in bst.h

Part 4 is in avlbst.h - I did not add any of the test files to git
